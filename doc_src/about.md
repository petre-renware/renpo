<br>Our 'Honour code of conduct' is a free document who can be studied by anyone.
<br><br>
Most of our software products are simply freeware, mostly beig MIT licensed. 
Even if a software product is not listed as "freeware", for sure you'll find a community license available for it. 
What you will need to pay for are <em>services</em> where human manpower is required, all /em>materials</em> which must be bought 
(and you'll find all details about them), all <em>third party items</em>, like licenses, servicies or subscriptions required (or buy them yourself) and so on.
<br><br>
Our knowledge relates to distributed systems and architectures, IT project management, systems implementation, engineering and architectures, simple applications or 
complex systems, embedded systems and all mostly known IoT 'gadgets', applications and development boards (Arduino, ESP, Py..., Raspberry, and so on). We love to combine 
analog electronic with digital one, from simple 'learning LEDs' to analog signals pattern recognition.<br>
