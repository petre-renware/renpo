## Software development

Software development is assured at all levels and usual and current languages.

Also, there are "special" software development services dedicated to projects where legacy old languages are involved (Cobol, Fortran, and so on).

Tipically these services are performed on a **time* & material** basis, but they can also be executed on **fixed price** basis.

The [SPRILI document](ready-made-docs/RENware_SPRILI_Standard_Price_List_EN.pdf) offers more details regarding these services.
